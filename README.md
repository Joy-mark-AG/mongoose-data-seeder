# mongoose-data-seeder
This package is refactored from origianl Sam Verschueren's [mongoose-seeder](https://github.com/SamVerschueren/mongoose-seeder) package, I only did minor code change to make it as ES6 class and working with mongoose 5.x.

I need do this refactoring due to an internal MERN project, I publish this package hoping it might be useful for someone who also need seed a MongoDB for his or her project using Node and MongoDB with Mongoose.
